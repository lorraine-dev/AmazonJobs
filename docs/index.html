                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>Amazon strives to be Earth's most customer-centric company where people can find and discover virtually anything they want to buy online. Selling Partners (SPs) are a critical part of Amazon’s ecosystem to deliver on our vision of offering the Earth’s largest selection and lowest prices. Over 2 million Sellers sell on Amazon and we obsess over providing world class support to them. In EU, we continue to observe an unprecedented wave of legislation that impacts SP experience (for sellers and vendors), constrains selection and jeopardizes growth. This increases the complexity and cost of selling in EU and makes compliance the primary barrier to SP launches in the region.

Environmental aims to transform the way Sellers and Vendors can fulfil their compliance obligations under new and evolving sustainability regulations in the EU and beyond, and help them sell on Amazon. These include rules such as the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), France’s Climate and Resilience Law, and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which introduce requirements around emissions transparency, environmental reporting, and responsible supply chain practices.

As a Product Manager on the team, you will define the product vision, strategy, requirements and roadmap for multiple products related to sustainability compliance. You will create consensus with both internal and external teams like software engineering, design, business, compliance, legal, public policy and external service provider teams. You will develop an in-depth understanding of the business, champion the needs of the customers and dive deep on technology and operational implications of the products you own.

You are the right person for this role if you are customer obsessed, a self-starter, a natural problem solver, a strong communicator and have a passion for delivering high quality work. You are excited about the positive impact sustainability regulations can have for Sellers and Vendors and thrive in a fast-paced and entrepreneurial environment, unhindered by ambiguity or multiple competing priorities.

Key job responsibilities
- Define the vision and working backwards plan for building scalable, low-friction compliance solutions to enable Sellers and Vendors to meet evolving sustainability regulations in the EU and beyond.

- Identify opportunities, create business cases, and champion your vision to build organizational alignment around priorities, features, and capabilities required to support SPs across carbon and supply chain due diligence regulations.

- Write product requirements and specifications that translate complex regulatory needs into scalable, tech-driven solutions.

- Work closely with engineering, go-to-market, operations, legal, and other product teams to define and continuously improve your product.

- Define, prioritize, and plan the resources needed for successful product delivery, ensuring timelines align with regulatory enforcement dates.

- Communicate product vision, release plans, and impact to leadership and cross-functional stakeholders.

About the team
Who are we? We are part of the Stores Compliance team, born in 2018. We started our journey with a team of 15 individuals which has now grown to 400+ team members in 6 regions. We represent more than 9 job families and 25+ nationalities. Our core values are innovation, inclusion and building others. We write on walls, obsess about our sellers and vendors and are known for our resilience.</p>
