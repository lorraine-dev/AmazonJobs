                        <p>Amazon strives to be Earth's most customer-centric company where people can find and discover virtually anything they want to buy online. Selling Partners (SPs) are a critical part of Amazon’s ecosystem to deliver on our vision of offering the Earth’s largest selection and lowest prices. Over 2 million Sellers sell on Amazon and we obsess over providing world class support to them. In EU, we continue to observe an unprecedented wave of legislation that impacts SP experience (for sellers and vendors), constrains selection and jeopardizes growth. This increases the complexity and cost of selling in EU and makes compliance the primary barrier to SP launches in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental aims to transform the way Sellers and Vendors can fulfil their compliance obligations under new and evolving sustainability regulations in the EU and beyond, and help them sell on Amazon. These include rules such as the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), France’s Climate and Resilience Law, and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which introduce requirements around emissions transparency, environmental reporting, and responsible supply chain practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Product Manager on the team, you will define the product vision, strategy, requirements and roadmap for multiple products related to sustainability compliance. You will create consensus with both internal and external teams like software engineering, design, business, compliance, legal, public policy and external service provider teams. You will develop an in-depth understanding of the business, champion the needs of the customers and dive deep on technology and operational implications of the products you own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the right person for this role if you are customer obsessed, a self-starter, a natural problem solver, a strong communicator and have a passion for delivering high quality work. You are excited about the positive impact sustainability regulations can have for Sellers and Vendors and thrive in a fast-paced and entrepreneurial environment, unhindered by ambiguity or multiple competing priorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key job responsibilities&lt;br/&gt;- Define the vision and working backwards plan for building scalable, low-friction compliance solutions to enable Sellers and Vendors to meet evolving sustainability regulations in the EU and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Identify opportunities, create business cases, and champion your vision to build organizational alignment around priorities, features, and capabilities required to support SPs across carbon and supply chain due diligence regulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Write product requirements and specifications that translate complex regulatory needs into scalable, tech-driven solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Work closely with engineering, go-to-market, operations, legal, and other product teams to define and continuously improve your product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Define, prioritize, and plan the resources needed for successful product delivery, ensuring timelines align with regulatory enforcement dates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Communicate product vision, release plans, and impact to leadership and cross-functional stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the team&lt;br/&gt;Who are we? We are part of the Stores Compliance team, born in 2018. We started our journey with a team of 15 individuals which has now grown to 400+ team members in 6 regions. We represent more than 9 job families and 25+ nationalities. Our core values are innovation, inclusion and building others. We write on walls, obsess about our sellers and vendors and are known for our resilience.</p>

A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $85+ million since.<br><br>*As part of A·Team, you can expect:*<br><br>- **High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies** sent your way; generally $90-$150+/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/Insight/Tiger/etc.<br>- **Work alongside friends old &amp; new:** our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.<br>- **Full autonomy:** say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.<br>- **Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:** for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.<br>- **Keep 100% of what you earn:** if you charge $120/hr, you get $120/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on *top* of your rate.<br><br>**How to apply:**<br><br>Go here: [https://build.a.team/remotivereferral](https://build.a.team/remotivereferral) + mention Remotive. We respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><br>**What you’ll do:**<br><br>- Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests. Find the right pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would<br>- Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.<br>- You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.<br><br>**Who A·Team is for:**<br><br>- Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.<br>- Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.<br>- The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing<br><br>**Who A·Team is not for:**<br><br>- People looking for small gigs<br>- Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites<br>- Those still early in their careers (&lt;4 years) and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)<br><br>**Our long-term vision:**<br><br>[A·Team](https://build.a.team/remotivereferral) is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. <br><br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $60 million+  from Insight Partenrs, Tiger Global, NFX, RocNation, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.<br><br>![](https://remotive.com/job/track/1919265/blank.gif?source=public_api)</p>
