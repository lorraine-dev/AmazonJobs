                        <p>Amazon strives to be Earth's most customer-centric company where people can find and discover virtually anything they want to buy online. Selling Partners (SPs) are a critical part of Amazon’s ecosystem to deliver on our vision of offering the Earth’s largest selection and lowest prices. Over 2 million Sellers sell on Amazon and we obsess over providing world class support to them. In EU, we continue to observe an unprecedented wave of legislation that impacts SP experience (for sellers and vendors), constrains selection and jeopardizes growth. This increases the complexity and cost of selling in EU and makes compliance the primary barrier to SP launches in the region.<br/><br/>Environmental aims to transform the way Sellers and Vendors can fulfil their compliance obligations under new and evolving sustainability regulations in the EU and beyond, and help them sell on Amazon. These include rules such as the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), France’s Climate and Resilience Law, and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which introduce requirements around emissions transparency, environmental reporting, and responsible supply chain practices.<br/><br/>As a Product Manager on the team, you will define the product vision, strategy, requirements and roadmap for multiple products related to sustainability compliance. You will create consensus with both internal and external teams like software engineering, design, business, compliance, legal, public policy and external service provider teams.
