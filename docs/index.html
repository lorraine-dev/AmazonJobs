                        <p>Amazon strives to be Earth's most customer-centric company where people can find and discover virtually anything they want to buy online. Selling Partners (SPs) are a critical part of Amazon’s ecosystem to deliver on our vision of offering the Earth’s largest selection and lowest prices. Over 2 million Sellers sell on Amazon and we obsess over providing world class support to them. In EU, we continue to observe an unprecedented wave of legislation that impacts SP experience (for sellers and vendors), constrains selection and jeopardizes growth. This increases the complexity and cost of selling in EU and makes compliance the primary barrier to SP launches in the region.<br/><br/>Environmental aims to transform the way Sellers and Vendors can fulfil their compliance obligations under new and evolving sustainability regulations in the EU and beyond, and help them sell on Amazon.

                        <p>We currently have a fantastic opportunity for someone to join the
**Automation Systems Research Team**
as
**Lead Research Scientist in Automated Logistics Systems**
reporting to the
**Research Director of Automation, Digitalization, and Cyber Security**
in Luxembourg.


**Overview**
FM is a leading property insurer of the world's largest businesses, providing more than one-third of FORTUNE 1000-size companies with engineering-based risk management and property insurance solutions. FM helps clients maintain continuity in their business operations by drawing upon state-of-the-art loss-prevention engineering and research; risk management skills and support services; tailored risk transfer capabilities; and superior financial strength. To do so, we rely on a dynamic, culturally diverse group of employees, working in more than 100 countries, in a variety of challenging roles.


Industrial Automation, digitalization, and cyber security are identified areas with increasing challenges and risks in all Industries in the next decades. To provide the best-in-class actionable science-based loss preparedness and prevention solutions to businesses, FM is making vast investments into this area over the coming years, starting with the creation of the dedicated global Research Center for Automation, Digitalization, and Cyber Security headquartered in Luxembourg.


This position will be based in Luxembourg, the headquarter for the global Industrial Digitalization research activities and home to the new FM Science and Technology Center in Europe currently under development that will also serve as the company’ regional headquarters. The Center will expand and enhance FM’s worldwide research including the research headquarters in Norwood, MA, USA, the FM Research Campus in Rhode Island, USA and the regional climate science team for Asia at the FM Centre in Singapore.


**Context of the position**
You will be part of the Automation Systems Research Team within FM’s Research Division, that consists of scientists studying industrial automation, digitalization, digital twins, and cyber security. It is headquartered in EMEA (Luxembourg) with additional locations in the U.S. (Norwood, Massachusetts), and (possibly in the future) in Asia (Singapore).


The goal of the group is to assess and reduce industrial risk as a result of increased digitalization of infrastructure and processes, by staying abreast of state-of-the-art implementations, developments, and roll-out of Automated Logistics System technologies and concepts, partnering with the world’s top Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Research Institutes and other engineers and researchers, and building on the practical experience from over 1300 engineers that perform over 100,000 site-specific risk assessments each year.


While the research is similar in technical rigor to that conducted at universities and in top government and industrial laboratories, the results are used to protect mutual client owner businesses via site-specific engineering, underwriting, product certification, claims, sales, and other organizations within the FM Group.


**Role**
You will be responsible for identifying, planning, coordinating, and conducting research related to the increasingly widespread use of Automated Logistics System technologies and solutions in industrial applications. In particular, the associated risks of physical damage to equipment and/or stock in process resulting from Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems and other solutions in modern Logistics centers, as well and scientifically proven protection solutions to help mitigate such risks are the focus of this position.


**Responsibilities Include**

- Perform fundamental and applied research to understand the technologies as well as their applications, and to assess property damage risks, relating implementations of automated logistics solutions.
- Develop industrial digitalization risk scenarios and innovative mitigation strategies related with increasing use of automation in logistics centers (e.g. Industry 4.0, digital twins, AI in industrial applications).
- Conduct strategic projects from scope to implementation, make use of most appropriate methods, technologies, and models.
- Maintain contact with industry leaders to track trends related to automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS), and related automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and autonomous robotic vehicles (AMRs).
- Coordinate your activities with internal stakeholders, guiding internal and external research experts, and manage relationships with academic institutes and standardization bodies.
- Actively drive forward risk evaluation knowhow through attendance and participation in conferences/industry events/renowned industrial and scientific journals.

**Qualified Candidates Must Have**

- Demonstrated project, research, and team management abilities. The job title and level may be adjusted depending on qualifications and experience.
- Proven track record in successfully implementing projects and technologies in Logistics Systems.
- Strong knowledge of industrial control systems, IoT technologies, cloud and edge computing, data analytics and digital twin concepts as well as exposure to cybersecurity principles and best practices.
- Background with industry standards and regulations related to automated storage systems design and application.
- An extensive personal network of experts in OEMs, research, or governmental agencies as well as in industry consortia associated with automated logistics systems
- A PhD in Engineering, Computer Science or field related to automation systems. An MSc with extensive appropriate industrial research experience in industrial automation, process engineering, or a similar role also accepted with a minimum of 10 years’ work experience.

**Desired Skills And Competency Areas**

- Exceptional communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to engage effectively with clients and partners at all levels.
- Strong analytical, problem-solving and decision-making skills, with the ability to translate complex technical concepts into actionable insights, strategies and plans.
- Strong leadership skills: ability to manage teams and lead projects.
- Able to envision, create, implement, and gain acceptance of new industrial digitalization driven risk scenarios.
- Shown background in business development and strategy skills (e.g. through MBA) are desirable.

                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>*You must be located in the Americas, Europe, or Israel to apply.*

[A·Team](https://build.a.team/remotivereferral) is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing.

After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $85+ million since.

*As part of A·Team, you can expect:*

- **High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies** sent your way; generally $90-$150+/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/Insight/Tiger/etc.
- **Work alongside friends old & new:** our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.
- **Full autonomy:** say "no" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.
- **Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:** for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.
- **Keep 100% of what you earn:** if you charge $120/hr, you get $120/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on *top* of your rate.

**How to apply:**

Go here: [https://build.a.team/remotivereferral](https://build.a.team/remotivereferral) + mention Remotive. We respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.

**What you’ll do:**

- Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests. Find the right pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would
- Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.
- You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.

**Who A·Team is for:**

- Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.
- Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.
- The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing

**Who A·Team is not for:**

- People looking for small gigs
- Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites
- Those still early in their careers (<4 years) and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)

**Our long-term vision:**

[A·Team](https://build.a.team/remotivereferral) is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. 

To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $60 million+  from Insight Partenrs, Tiger Global, NFX, RocNation, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.
